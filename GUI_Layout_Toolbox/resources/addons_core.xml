  <summary>Layout manager for MATLAB graphical user interfaces</summary>
  <description>This toolbox provides tools to create sophisticated MATLAB graphical user interfaces that resize gracefully.  The classes supplied can be used in combination to produce virtually any user interface layout.

* Arrange MATLAB user interface components horizontally, vertically or in grids
* Mix fixed- and variable-size components
* Resize components interactively by dragging dividers
* Show and hide components using tabs and panels
* Show part of a large component in a scrollable panel

This toolbox was developed by David Sampson and Ben Tordoff from the [Consulting Services](http://www.mathworks.com/services/consulting/) group at MathWorks.

This version is for MATLAB R2014b and later.  For R2014a and earlier, see [version 1](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27758-gui-layout-toolbox).</description>
