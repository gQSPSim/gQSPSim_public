To run tests from MATLAB:
1. Setup gQSPSim as usual. E.g. DefinePaths etc. 
2. While in the top of the gQSSim directory (root directory) run
3. >> run tests

The actual tests are in the tgQSPsim.m file. The MATLAB unit test harness will 
run any files started with 't' in the target directory. Avoid adding any files 
in this directory starting with the letter 't' if they are not meant to be tests. 

There is a testing harness file in this directory:
gQSPSimTester.m: A subclass of the QSPViewer.App allowing us to construct a QSPViewer and 
    access its private methods. 

The remaining files are used to hook up the tests to the gitlab pipeline CI. The files are:
gQSPSimTesterScript.sh and driver.m. The former is called directly from the gitlab-runner 
shell and it in turn calls matlab and asks it to execute the driver.

The baselines directory contains the gQSPSim project folders with functionality results 
included. These are used to validate the results obtained when running the tests.
