# gQSPSim
## Description
gQSPSim is a GUI-based MATLAB® application that performs key steps in QSP model development and analyses, including:

1) model calibration using global and local optimization methods 
2) development of virtual subjects to explore variability and uncertainty in the represented biology 
3) simulations of virtual populations for different interventions.

gQSPSim works with SimBiology®-built models, utilizing components such as species, doses, variants, and rules. All functionalities are equipped with an interactive visualization interface and the ability to generate presentation-ready figures. In addition, standardized gQSPSim sessions can be shared or saved for future extension and reuse.

The source code and case studies are included in the referenced github account. The description of gQSPSim and case studies are in the publication titled "gQSPSim: a GUI application based on SimBiology® for standardized QSP model development and application".
